Core Function
REE manages quantum state evolution through the enhanced evolution equation:
∂ρ/∂t = -i/ℏ[H, ρ] + L[ρ] + η Tr(Eρ)S


Where:
* ρ: Quantum state density matrix
* H: System Hamiltonian
* L[ρ]: Lindblad dissipator for open quantum systems
* η: Feedback coupling strength
* E: Environmental measurement operators
* S: System response operators
